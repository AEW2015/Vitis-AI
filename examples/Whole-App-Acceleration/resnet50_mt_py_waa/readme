  1. Prepare test data set
mkdir -p images
Download 1000 images at http://image-net.org/download-images and copy it to ./images

  2. Run resnet50 on zcu102
  sample : python3 resnet50.py 4 ../../VART/samples/resnet50_mt_py/model_dir_for_zcu102/resnet50.elf

  3. Run resnet50 on U50
  sample : /usr/bin/python3 resnet50.py 4 ../../VART/samples/resnet50_mt_py/model_dir_for_U50/resnet50.xmodel
  
  3. Run resnet50 with waa on zcu102
  sample : env XILINX_XRT=/usr python3 resnet50_waa.py 4 ../../VART/samples/resnet50_mt_py/model_dir_for_zcu102/resnet50.elf

  4. Run resnet50 with waaa on U50
